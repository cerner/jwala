# Do not delete this file since this is loaded by application properties regardless if it contains any properties or not!
# We are reusing JschServiceImpl to delete the created services and the said service uses ApplicationProperties.
# We can refactor ApplicationProperties to remove this dependency but due to time constraints it would be easier to
# maintain this file for now.
